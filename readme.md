#Not-So-Forbidden AJAX Doughnuts

You're about to write AJAX-backed JavaScript that will access an API and loop through/display data using `setInterval`.

Make use of the fantastic and delicious https://api.doughnuts.ga.  Your task is to use your JS skills to fetch all the doughnuts in our database. Then, loop through the array and display each doughnut for one second.

##Getting Started

* Fork and clone this repository
* Run `npm install` to install dependencies
  * `npm start` - start the BrowserSync server
  * `npm run lint:css` - lint CSS
  * `npm run lint:js` - lint JS

## Requirements

* Implement a jQuery AJAX request to the GA Doughnuts API. Make sure that the data can be printed to the Chrome console before continuing.
* Once the data has been received from the API, use `setInterval` to go through the array and display each doughnut to the screen, along with the flavor.

## Deliverable

Make a list of existing doughnuts appear on the page, along with the flavor of each doughnut.

## Bonuses

* Add a stop button using `clearInterval`
* Add a resume button
